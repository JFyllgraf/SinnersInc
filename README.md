## Leisure project for interaction design course
A prototype developed during a university course in collaboration with a tattoo company. In short, the prototype has two sides to help the company in dealing with customer data; (1) a customer side with a questionary regarding master, and hygiene questions and (2) a client side where the company could manage and see statistics of the data. Additionally, the customers were flagged if there were issues regarding their hygiene answers.

The project uses nodejs and the ionic framework. The data is stored in Firebase.
